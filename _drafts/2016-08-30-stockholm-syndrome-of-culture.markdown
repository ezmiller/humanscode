I have PhD in history, but I no longer earn my living from academia. Today, I work
as a programmer. But for all the differences in the substance of the vocational 
shift that I have made, the most accurate description of the shift that I can think
of, and the one that I normally provide with those whom I discuss this shift, is that
I have moved from a bad labor market to a good one. More than anything else -- more 
than the fact that I know express ideas in strangely formal syntaxes, more than the
fact that the work that I now do is usually considered rather inhuman in contrast
to the work done in the "humanities", and more than the fact that occupational world
that I now occupy is one very much obsessed with the "future" as opposed the past --
it is the conditions under which I labor that have most altered my life.

I am making this point here because I think that it is a useful basis from which to
register what one might call a critique or better yet a soulful complaint about certain
parts of the world of academia, in particular those parts that we call the "humanities."
I say it's better to register what I'm writing here as a complaint, rather than a
critique, because I suppose a critique ought to be made form a position of solid
confidence, whereas what I have to say here stems in part from a realization that I
have been, in my life, for complex reasons, thoroughly rocked and ruined by academia.
Though I no longer work in that domain, to a large degree my sense of self, my value
system, and my subjectivity are still shaped by the worldview of the academic scholar.
What I have to say here, in other words, is not easily separable from the value system
sustained within academia, even though I seek to criticize it. For this reason, I demote
my argument to a complaint, partly anticipating the critque that I will receive: that
I'm just complaining, that my troubles stem purely from my own limitations and
characteristics, that I simply wasn't tough or smart enough to join that particular
club. And that all may be true. But I still think what I have to say can
have some value, perhaps simply as a kind of "negative" (or negating) critique. 
Perhaps from my position of weakness, I am able to see aspects of the current state
of academia that deserve to be radically negated, and cast out.

Be that as it may, there are two points that I want to build my comments around. 
The first is the insight that the best way to examine the nature of the academia
today is to consider it first and foremost as a labor market. This is what I would
say, and it is what I do say, to everyone person I know who is considering a PhD.
And  by this measure, as I think most everyone knows, academia is a bad labor market.
[INSERT STATISTICS]. 

The second point that I want to make, perhaps a bit more novel,
is that viewing the humanities in this light reveals some emergent qualities of 
the academic labor market that make it an especially dangerous context in which to
labor, not because of the physical risks that this labor involves, although
dissertating can be very bad for one's back, but because of the mental risks it 
generates. Because, in short, those who enter this domain of labor, who take on or
are socialized into its vocational system of values, end up suffering from a I
think it quite accurate to call a kind of Stockholm Syndrome of Culture. 

In a world of labor in which there are increasingly few forms of labor not circumscribed by
the capitalist markets drive for profit, the world of academia seems to offer
an alternative domain of employment -- a domain in which the back breaking hours
spent reading and writing can yield a human product whose worth is not (and
cannot be) defined in market terms. The value of these tomes that PhD students
write, of the books they plan, and of the position that they dream of occupying
in society is one that exists in another, almost spiritual domain: the domain
of (big C) Culture. And, it is for the right or the opportunity or the dream of 
contributing to this unique domain that so many bright and beautifully idealistic men and women
set themselves down to the task of earning for themselves a PhD, even when, in
terms of the numbers, this is probably the worst economic decision they could make.

Why do I call this a Stockholm syndrome you ask? I do so because I think that at
this point these young idealistic men and women are captives of a system that 
perpetuates the intense longings and desires of the middle class -- the desire for
forms of intellectual and cultural authority that stem from one's vocation --
but which has long lost the ability to provide the economic basis for this kind
of life. But instead of acknolwedging this fact, and then making choices that might
guarantee a more secure material basis for a contented and happy life, huge numbers
of people every year set their sights upon a path of study that is designed to
prepare them for entry into this...into this very bad labor market. All for Culture.
All for the chance to capture for themselves the middle class dream of meaningful
work. 








Anyone who has completed a PhD in the humanities is very likely familiar with the
peculiar genre of essay, composed by indivudal sturggling to survive in the bleak
academic landscape, that we might call the academic essay. These essays are replete
on the web. I read a ton of them during the late years of my PhD. I read them
because I was curious what happened when academics decided to contemplate or actually
chose (ghasp!) to leave academia. Where did they end up working? How was their 
academic training perceived in the non-academic (that is to say, purely capitalist)
labor market? What, above all, did it feel like to sell one's labor on the labor
market? Could one find satisfaction? 


Points to hit:
- [ ] bad labor market -> good labor market 
- [ ] this is an entry in the genre of writings by betrayed academics
- [ ] unalienated labor
