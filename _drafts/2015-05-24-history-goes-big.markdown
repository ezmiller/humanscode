The historians David Armitage and Jo Guldi, who became aware of this encounter in part through the fact of declining enrollments in the History Departments, have recently diagnosed the cultural shift as taking the shape of a crisis of the humanities -- a "bonfire of the humanities" as they put it -- related to a speed differential between the academy and the rest of the world. On the one hand, there is the world outside of academe -- "We live in moment of accelerating crisis that is characterised by the shortage of long-term thinking"; on the other, there is academia which since at least the 1980s and probably more significantly since the rise of professionalized scholarship at the end of the 19th century has been marked by increasing specialization and fragmentation, an overall narrowing of horizons. In response, Guldi and Armitage suggest that historians should go big; taking inspiration from Ferdiand Braudel, they suggest that historians should embrace the <em>longe-duree</em> and attempt narative scopes of hundreds or even thousands of years. In order to do so, they suggest historians should embrace the digital and in particular its capacity to parse "big data". Indeed, revealingly, doing so they suggest, historians might just reacquire some relevance and indeed also some of the chromed up sex appeal of Silicon Valley:

<blockquote>
If historians -- or any other historically minded scholars, from students of literature to sociologists -- take up this challenge, they may find thsemlves in the avant grade of information design. They could collaborate with archivists, data scientists, economists and climate scientists in the curating of larger and more synthetic database for studying change over time. In the future, historians' expertise could be sought out in sectors beyond the university. Historians may become tool-builders and tool-reviewers as well as tool-consumers and tool-teachers. Indeed, these changes have the potential to revolutionisse the life of some professional historains, as faculty provide data analysis for legislative committees, advicse activist campaigns, or consult with Silicon Valley startups, and thereby regain the public role they traditionally cocupied and deserve once more to regain...

Armitage and Guldi's book is thus a self-conscious call-to-action by historians confronted with what they perceive to be the sharply declining relevance of their profession. Of course, the isolation of historians or other professions is nothing new, as they themselves note, but the rapid acceleration of time and the massive increase in the amounts of data and the need to parse that data with computers has 

Other forms: how will it change academic subjectivity? What is the computational? 



One one level, ironically, it is a new disciplinary domain, replete with its own communication organ, the Journal of Digital Humanites, its own conferences and meetings, and, incraesingly, generous funding and thus it represents new job pathways within the exceedingly competetive and bare academic job market. If it is a discipline, however, it seems to be inherently interdiscplinary, in part because the digital is useful in potentiallty different ways to different disciplines. 

- That is the why, what is the what? 
- The point here is that the encounter between technology and humanities raises a broader set of critical questions: what are the consequences of this shift in culture? Some of these have to do with the effects of technology on humna subjectivity in general, but also with the subjectivity of scholars themsevles.. 
- concrete domains of digital humaniteis: 1) pedagogy, 2) publishing, 3) data analysis, 4) communication.
